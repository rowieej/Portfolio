						<p>What's going on?  My name is Rowena and I'm about to tell you a few things about myself.  I was born and raised in New Jersey, but my parents are originally from the Philippines.  I have one older sister, one older brother, and one younger brother.  I have been told I show symptoms of suffering from middle child syndrome, but I like think that I'm just pretty awesome.
						<br><br>
						You know what else is awesome?  <strong>Unicorns.</strong>  Up until I was about 21 years of age, I truly believed unicorns not only existed and just were endangered species, but I also believed they held the secret to youth in their blood.  I know this may seem silly to you, but I don't know, they're still awesome!  Well to my surprise, turns out unicorns ARE real, according to NYTimes this past year.  Unfortunately, they were not magical like I thought, but I will still bask in the fact that they once existed.  Anyway, back to me.  Currently, I am a New Jersey licensed Cosmetologist.  I've been doing hair professionally for over 13 years and have conquered all areas in my field that I wanted you.  Prior to doing hair, I was in college changing my major as if it was my job.  I explored Graphic Design, Computer Information Systems, and Nursing.  The only natural step was to go into Cosmetology next, right?  Well...I did it...loved it...stuck to it...and now I'm done.  I hope you enjoy my page because now I'm on to my next adventure-- to acquire super powers as a Web Developer!</p>
